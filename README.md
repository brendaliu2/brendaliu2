# Hi, I'm Brenda 👋🏼

I graduated from New York University with a BA in Economics, and more recently, I graduated from Rithm School's Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.

Prior to pivoting to the tech industy, I specialized in various points of the supply chain within the fashion industry. In my last role on the Merchandise Planning team at J.Crew, I worked with quarterly budgets, historical sales, and current trends to decide how much inventory to purchase for upcoming sales cycles.

I hope to find an enviornment where I can keep developing my engineering skillset as well as apply some problem-solving skills from my previous positions.
